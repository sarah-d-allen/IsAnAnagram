        Algorithm confirm that both strings have same letters by comparing 
        first word to second and removing letters that are the same from both words 

        Homework: Finish writing the algorithm. Start using data structures and control flow structures in your algorithm.
          - Remember: You don't have to get all the way there in a single leap. You can do it a piece at a time.
          - Also: Strings are arrays of characters, or at least can be looked at as an array of characters. Arrays are data structures. 
          - You will likely have to use some placeholder variables of some kind, because modifying arrays that you're looping over causes problems. 
          - You can meetup and do some pair programming on your own.
          - (Recursion may make the solution simpler. But if it's confusing, there are other ways. Don't beat yourself up.)

/*
My thoughts on this problem:
We've got firstWord and secondWord. Both need to be fed into arrays like so:

const firstArray = firstWord.slice();
const secondArray = secondWord.slice();

From here, we need a function that reads through each value in firstArray and runs
a find() against secondArray. This would knock out the first match each time. We'd
need to remove the matched value from secondArray with each loop. If all of firstArray's
values found a match in secondArray, isAnAnagram could return true.

This doesn't cover factors like one array having more values than the other, but the tests
don't consider that, either. That's where I'm at right now.

// sample words 
let firstWord = "domes"; 
let secondWord = "mode";

// split words into arrays of individual letters
const firstArray = firstWord.split(''); 
const secondArray = secondWord.split('');

// log arrays in console for user to see
console.log(firstArray, secondArray);
